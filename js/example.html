    // Creating our tibHandler object, containing all the functions we'll need to initiate and process tibs.
    // We supply the constructor function with three paramaters. In order:
    // 1. The bitcoin address to tib. This is required.
    // 2. A callback URL. This allows us to supply behaviour to execute on completion of a tib.
    // 3. Optionally, a duration, in days, within which to acknowledge the tib. For example, we want the tib to
    // expire in 3 days, so we feed '3' as a third parameter.

    bd.eventListeners('custom-tib-class');
    // Having populated bd with our tih handling functions, we can then call bd.eventListeners to have the script
    // watch a specific element. Here, we include the parameter 'custom-tib-class' to correspond with the button
    // we created earlier. If we didn't specify this parameter, it would default to and try to attach listeners
    // to any element with the 'bd-tib-btn' class.
