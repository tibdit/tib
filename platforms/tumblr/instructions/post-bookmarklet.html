<p>To make things a little easier when creating new blog posts and such, we have created <a href="https://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/tumblr-bdK.html">a bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll want to do is visit the above <a href="https://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/tumblr-bdK.html">link</a>;  and insert your public Bitcoin address. Click submit and a bookmarklet link will appear. For example:</p>

<img src="http://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/instructions/img/tumblr-instructions-example-1.png" alt="image">

<p>Click, hold and drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar/folder in your web browser. For example:</p>

<img src="http://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/instructions/img/tumblr-instructions-example-2.png"
     alt="image">

<p>Now, whenever youâ€™re creating a post, before you hit 'Post', leave the edit view open and click your bookmarklet. This will automatically place a text-based button into the end of your post for you - this text button can be seen from the tumblr dashboard, not just within your individual tumblr page.</p>
