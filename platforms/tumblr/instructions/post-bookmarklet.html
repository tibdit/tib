<p>To make things a little easier when creating new blog posts and such, we have created <a href="https://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/tumblr-bdK.html">a bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll want to do is visit the above <a href="https://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/tumblr-bdK.html">link</a>;  and insert your public Bitcoin address. Click submit and a bookmarklet link will appear. For example:</p>

<img src="http://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/instructions/img/tumblr-instructions-example-1.png" alt="image">

<p>Click, hold and drag the bookmarklet (<strong>1</strong> below) to your bookmarks bar/folder in your web browser. Depending on your
    browser,
you should see something along the lines of <strong>2</strong> below:</p>

     alt="image">

<p>Now, whenever youâ€™re creating a post, before you hit 'Post', leave the edit view open and click your bookmarklet. This will automatically place a text-based button into the end of your post for you - this text button can be seen from the tumblr dashboard, not just within your individual tumblr page/theme. The display of this text button within your editor
    will depend on what we will refer to as your "Editor Mode." There are 3 available modes; Rich Text
    (usually the Default,) HTML, and Markdown. You may check the mode your editor is currently in by clicking the cog in the upper-right of your editor pane, and seeing the "Text editor" property (as in <strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>
    below:)</p>

<p>In the case of Markdown and HTML editor modes, a HTML code will be inserted. If you browse to "Preview" within
    your edit window, you will see the button as it will appear to your readers. In the case of Rich Text mode, the
    button will be displayed immediately as it will appear to your readers. It should look like this:</p>

<h2><b><a class='bd-tib-btn-tumblr-txt-test' href='https://tib.me/?PAD=mjR8der1h3J9QqRgtWcLuXQvJABx7QSDNX&TIB=www.tibbable.tumblr.com&SUB=tumblr-tibbable-xYCqP''>&#x2772;&#x26C0;&ensp;tib&ensp;&#x21AC;&#x2773;</a></b></h2>

<p>If you see this button in your post, then the bookmarklet is set up and ready to go! Now, having set your bookmarklet up, you may want to integrate tibbing into your tumblr theme - this will give you access to our dynamic buttons, which will respond to and count your tibs (including the ones made to the text buttons you just set up!) See <a
        href="http://tibbable.tumblr.com/post/142398330822/installing-the-tibit-bookmarklet">this post</a> for
    instructions on how to do so.</p>
