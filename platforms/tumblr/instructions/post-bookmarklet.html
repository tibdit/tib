<p>To make things a little easier when creating new blog posts and such, we have created <a href="https://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/tumblr-bdK.html">a bookmarklet</a>.</p>

<p>Click, hold and drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar/folder in your web browser. For example:</p>

<img src="http://widget.tibdit.com/assets/platforms/tumblr/instructions/img/tumblr-instructions-example-2.png"
