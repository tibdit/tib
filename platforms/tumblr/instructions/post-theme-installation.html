Installing the theme tib button.


<ol>
    <li>Go to theme HTML
    <ol>
        <li>Go to your tumblr dashboard<li>
        <li>Click the account icon (pictured below)</li>
        <li>Click “Edit appearance” under the appropriate tumblr</li>
        <li>Click “Edit theme” under “Website Theme”</li>
        <li>Click “Edit HTML” in the top left</li>
        [more image goodness]
    </li>
Add the javascript & css
Click inside the HTML frame to place your cursor
Press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to bring up the search bar
Type: “/head”
[show]
Add script snippet just above/before </head> tag (see below as an example - the bitcoin address highlighted is the public address of one of the team who uses it on their tumblr blog so don’t use this or they’ll get your tibs)


<script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/script.js/2.5.8/script.min.js'></script>
<script>
    $script('http://widget.tibdit.com/assets/js/tib-2.4.js', function() {
        tibInit( {
            'PAD' : '1FLKyEZqM2JPxi2m42QQevfuszFDzJKdVn', mytibs...
        'BTN' : 'bubble',
                'PLT' : 'tumblr'
    });
    });
</script>


Add the button
Click within the HTML pane, and hit Ctrl+F/Cmd+F again to bring up the search bar
This time, type “{Body}”
This should bring up one or more results - these “{Body}” instances represent the content of your tumblr posts, and you’ll likely want to paste the button snippet just below each of these. Why each, and not just once??
Paste the following button snippet below the {Body} block(s) (or anywhere else in your theme you might want to include a button)

{block:NotReblog}<button type='button' class='bd-tib-btn' data-bd-SUB='{PostID}' data-bd-TIB='{permalink}'></button>{/block:NotReblog}





Save
Open your tumblr in a new tab/window ( your-blog.tumblr.com )
Return to your original edit window/tab
Click Update Preview button at top of HTML edit panel  (what is seen at this stage [IMG]
Click Save button at top of HTML edit panel
Return to your tumblr - you should now see a tib button on each individual non-reblog post
Done - live tib buttons should be visible at the bottom of original posts.



If you select a size and then you don’t how it appears on your blog or a colour that doesn’t match, you can always redo these steps at any point.
